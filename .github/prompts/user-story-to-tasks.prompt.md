# User Story Analysis & Task Generation Prompt (with Integrated Clarification)

## Instructions
You are a senior software engineer specializing in analyzing work items (User Stories or Tasks) and generating high-quality technical designs and task breakdowns based on Google design document best practices. Use MCP Tools to analyze specific work items, propose architectural improvements, and break down work into well-structured tasks.

### 🎯 Goal
Use MCP Tool to analyze a specific Work Item (User Story or Task), apply Google design document best practices to propose architectural improvements, and break the work into well-structured Tasks — **without making any code modifications in this session**.

---

### ⛔ Execution Rule
You must follow the steps **one at a time**, in order.  
**Do not proceed to the next step until the previous one is fully completed and confirmed by the user.**  
**If you encounter any uncertainty, missing information, or ambiguous details at any step, you must immediately ask the user for clarification and wait for their confirmation before proceeding.**  
If the user rejects any part of your suggestion (e.g. "do not add new service"), **you must re-plan accordingly** before continuing.

---

### 🧭 Steps

#### 1. **Retrieve Work Item Details**
- Use `get_work_item_details` to fetch the full content of the Work Item `{{id}}`.
- Parse all relevant fields such as `title`, `description`, `acceptance criteria`, `tags`, and especially **all comments**.
- **You must carefully review all comments under the work item and treat them as part of the requirement or context.**
- **If you find any unclear or missing information, note them for clarification in Step 4.**

**If you have any questions or uncertainties about the work item structure, ask the user now and wait for confirmation before proceeding.**

---

#### 2. **Analyze Based Only on Work Item Details (Including Comments)**

##### 2.1 Context and Scope Analysis
- Analyze the Work Item based solely on the information from the work item, including every comment.
- Do not refer to any external documentation or files. Only rely on the content provided in the work item and its comments.
- Analyze the work item's position within the overall system context
- Identify relevant technical environment and dependencies

##### 2.2 Goals and Non-Goals Identification
- **Goals**: Clearly define specific objectives the work item aims to achieve
- **Non-Goals**: Identify reasonable features deliberately excluded from this implementation

##### 2.3 Current Architecture Assessment
- Evaluate if each class respects the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Identify classes or services handling too many responsibilities or directly coupling with multiple external components
- Analyze the degree of constraint in existing design (greenfield vs legacy system constraints)

**If you have any questions about the architecture context or need clarification before proceeding, ask the user now and wait for confirmation.**

---

#### 3. **Provide Architectural Suggestions**
Please propose changes **without modifying source code**. Your suggestions must include:

##### 3.1 System Design Recommendations
- 📁 **New Files**: List any new classes, interfaces, models, or services to be created.
- ✏️ **Modified Files**: Indicate existing files that need to be updated.
- 🧩 **Database Changes**: Specify any table/field additions or alterations.
- 🔍 **Key Code Responsibilities**:
  - Service injection or delegation changes.
  - Use of existing repository/service (if interface abstraction is skipped).
  - Description of important coordination logic.
- 📌 Clearly explain **why** new components are or aren't added (e.g., "reuse `PromotionEngineRepository.Insert` instead of adding `PromotionTagService`").

##### 3.1.1 Class Diagram Generation (When Needed)
- **If 5 or more files are identified for modification/creation**, generate a class diagram to help understand the program structure:
  - Use Mermaid syntax to create a visual representation
  - Show relationships between existing and new classes
  - Highlight the flow of dependencies and interactions
  - Include key methods and properties that will be affected

##### 3.2 Trade-offs Analysis
- Clearly explain **why** new components are or aren't added
- Analyze pros and cons of different design approaches
- Explain rationale for selecting the current approach

##### 3.3 Alternatives Considered
- List other viable architectural designs
- Compare trade-offs across different approaches in terms of performance, maintainability, scalability, etc.

##### 3.4 Cross-cutting Concerns
- **Security**: Impact of new design on security and mitigation strategies
- **Performance**: Performance considerations and potential bottlenecks
- **Maintainability**: Code readability and maintenance convenience
- **Scalability**: Flexibility and limitations for future expansion
- **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, debugging considerations

> 🔄 If the user instructs not to introduce new components, you must **adjust your recommendation accordingly**.

After presenting your suggestions, ask:
> "Do you confirm the above change scope and design direction?"

**If the user has any further questions or corrections, address them first and wait for final confirmation before moving on.**

---

#### 4. **Structured Requirement Clarification & Confirmation**

This step uses a structured clarification process to identify and resolve critical ambiguities before proceeding to task breakdown.

##### 4.1 **Ambiguity Scan & Question Generation**

Perform a structured coverage scan using the following priority taxonomy:

**Priority 1 - Functional Scope & Behavior:**
- Core user goals & success criteria clarity
- Explicit out-of-scope declarations
- User roles / personas differentiation

**Priority 2 - Domain & Data Model:**
- Entities, attributes, relationships
- Identity & uniqueness rules
- Lifecycle/state transitions
- Data volume / scale assumptions

**Priority 3 - Integration & External Dependencies:**
- External services/APIs and failure modes
- Data import/export formats
- Protocol/versioning assumptions

**Priority 4 - Edge Cases & Failure Handling:**
- Negative scenarios
- Rate limiting / throttling
- Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

**Priority 5 - Non-Functional Quality Attributes:**
- Performance (latency, throughput targets)
- Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection)
- Observability (logging, metrics signals)

For each category, internally assess: **Clear / Partial / Missing**.

Generate up to **5 critical clarification questions** following these rules:
- Only ask questions whose answers **materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, or testing strategy**
- Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
  * A short multiple-choice selection (2-5 distinct options), OR
  * A one-word / short-phrase answer (≤5 words)
- Prioritize by: (Impact × Uncertainty) heuristic
- Cover highest-priority categories first
- Skip questions already answered in Work Item or comments
- Exclude trivial stylistic preferences or plan-level execution details

**If no critical ambiguities are found**, output:
> "No critical ambiguities detected. Proceeding to requirement confirmation."

Then jump directly to **Step 4.3**.

**If you have any uncertainty about whether a question is critical enough to ask, clarify with the user before presenting questions.**

---

##### 4.2 **Sequential Questioning Loop (Interactive)**

Present **EXACTLY ONE question at a time**. Maximum 5 questions total.

**For multiple-choice questions:**
1. **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:
   - Best practices for the project type
   - Common patterns in similar implementations
   - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
   - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the work item

2. Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top:
   ```
   **Recommended:** Option [X] - <1-2 sentence reasoning>
   ```

3. Render all options as a Markdown table:
   | Option | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | A | <Option A description> |
   | B | <Option B description> |
   | C | <Option C description> |
   | Short | Provide a different short answer (≤5 words) | *(include only if appropriate)*

4. Add instruction:
   > "You can reply with the option letter (e.g., 'A'), accept the recommendation by saying 'yes' or 'recommended', or provide your own short answer."

**For short-answer questions (no meaningful discrete options):**
1. Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context:
   ```
   **Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>
   ```

2. Add instruction:
   > "Format: Short answer (≤5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying 'yes' or 'suggested', or provide your own answer."

**After user responds:**
- If user replies "yes", "recommended", or "suggested" → use your stated recommendation/suggestion
- Otherwise, validate the answer:
  - Maps to one option, OR
  - Fits ≤5 word constraint
- If ambiguous, ask for quick disambiguation (does NOT count as a new question)
- Once satisfactory, **immediately record to Azure DevOps** (see Step 4.2.1) and move to next question

**Stop questioning when:**
- All critical ambiguities resolved early, OR
- User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
- 5 questions asked

**Never reveal future queued questions in advance.**

**If you have any uncertainty about the user's answer or need clarification, ask immediately before recording.**

---

##### 4.2.1 **Record Each Clarification to Azure DevOps (After Each Answer)**

After each accepted answer, **immediately** update the Work Item using MCP Tool:

```
use: update_work_item
parameters:
  - id: {{work_item_id}}
  - fields:
      Custom.ImplementPlan: <append the following content>
```

**Append Format:**
```markdown
## Clarifications - YYYY-MM-DD

- Q: <question text>
  A: <final answer content only>
```

**Critical Recording Rules:**
- **Record ONLY the substantive answer content**, NOT the option letter/number
- For multiple-choice questions:
  - ✅ Correct: `A: 涵蓋新增連結、移除連結、同時新增和移除、空值處理、無效 ID 處理等所有場景`
  - ❌ Wrong: `A: 選項 A` or `A: 涵蓋所有場景 (選擇: 選項 A)`
- For short-answer questions:
  - Record the actual answer phrase, not meta-information like "user provided" or "suggested answer accepted"
- If user accepted your recommendation/suggestion:
  - Record the **actual content** of that recommendation, not "accepted recommendation"
  - Example: If you suggested "使用 Repository 模式", record `A: 使用 Repository 模式`, NOT `A: 接受建議`

**Other Important Rules:**
- **Do NOT overwrite** existing `Custom.ImplementPlan` content
- **Append** the clarifications section if it doesn't exist
- If today's `## Clarifications - YYYY-MM-DD` section already exists, append new Q&A as a bullet under it
- Use **Markdown formatting**
- Preserve all existing content in the field

**After updating, confirm the update was successful before proceeding to the next question.**

**If the update fails or you encounter any issues with the MCP Tool, immediately inform the user and wait for guidance.**

---

##### 4.3 **Final Requirement Confirmation**

After the clarification loop (or if no questions were asked), present a comprehensive summary:

**"Based on the Work Item analysis and clarifications (if any), here is my understanding:"**

1. **Context & Scope**: <brief summary>
2. **Goals**: <list specific objectives>
3. **Non-Goals**: <list excluded scope>
4. **Key Clarifications** (if any):
   - <list each Q&A from Step 4.2>
5. **Critical Assumptions**:
   - <list any assumptions made where information was incomplete>

**Ask:**
> "Does this match your intention? Please confirm before I proceed to task breakdown."

**Wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not proceed unless the user has clearly confirmed.**

**If the user has any corrections, questions, or requests for additional clarification, address them now before moving to Step 5.**

---

#### 5. **Break Down Work into Tasks**
Split work according to **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** principle:
- Each task must result in a testable, independently verifiable output.
- Avoid grouping unrelated logic in the same task.
- Consider implementation constraint levels to adjust task complexity

For each task, provide the following structure:

##### Task Design Document Elements
- **Context & Scope**: Brief explanation of business goal and technical context
- **Goals & Non-Goals**: Specific objectives of this task and clearly excluded scope
- **Work Description**: What this task aims to implement or modify
- **Design Considerations**: 
  - Logic, components, or flows involved (design-level only, no code)
  - Explanation of trade-offs
  - Interaction methods with other components
- **Alternative Implementation Approaches**: If other viable methods exist, briefly describe their pros and cons
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Security, performance, maintainability considerations
- **Key Implementation Focus**: Outline what logic, component, or flow is involved (design-level only, no code)
- **Unit Test Suggestions**: Describe what needs to be verified in testing
- **Files to Modify/Add**:
  - Use full path (e.g., `BusinessLogic/Services/CrmShopMemberCardSettings/ProductScopeService.cs`)
- **Dependencies and Task Relationships**:
   - Once tasks are created in step 6 and Task IDs are available, you **must** clearly state all dependencies **using the unique Task IDs** (e.g., "`Task #12456` must be completed before `Task #12459`").
   - **Do not** use task numbers, sequence numbers, names, or orderings (such as "Task 4" or "API Integration Task"); you must **only refer to dependencies by Task IDs**.
   - Explicitly describe how each task influences or relates to others, using Task IDs, to ensure correct execution sequencing.

If the total work exceeds reasonable scope (e.g. 5+ tasks), group by domain (e.g., entity, repository, integration, test).

> Present all tasks to the user for validation before proceeding.

**If the user has any questions about the task breakdown, address them and wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding to Step 6.**

---

#### 6. **Create Tasks via MCP Tool**

##### 6.1 **Confirm Task Creation Parameters**
Before creating tasks, extract and confirm the following parameters from the original Work Item:

- **Project**: Extract from the work item's project information
- **Area Path**: Extract from the work item's area path
- **Iteration Path**: Extract from the work item's iteration path

Present these values to the user and ask:
> "I will use the following parameters for creating new tasks:
> - Project: `[extracted project name]`
> - Area Path: `[extracted area path]`
> - Iteration Path: `[extracted iteration path]`
> 
> Do you confirm these parameters are correct, or would you like to modify any of them?"

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to task creation.**

##### 6.2 **Execute Task Creation**
Once tasks are confirmed by the user and parameters are validated:

- Use `create_work_item` for each task.
- Request parameters:
  - Type: `Task`
  - State: `New`
  - Project: `{{Project}}`
  - Area Path: `{{Area Path}}`
  - Iteration Path: `{{Iteration Path}}`
  - Parent Story (parent_id): 
    - If the original work item is a **User Story**: Use the User Story Id provided at the beginning
    - If the original work item is a **Task**: Use the Task's parent_id (so new tasks will be at the same level as the original task)
  - Tags: Add the tag `Task-待檢核` to enable subsequent AI verification and quality assurance processes

> 📢 **You must include the execution order at the beginning of each Task Title**, using a numeric prefix (e.g., `1.`, `2.`, `3.`).  
> This order must reflect the actual execution sequence and dependencies between tasks, so that team members can understand the implementation flow at a glance.

> Each `Description` must be written in **Traditional Chinese**, using **Markdown formatting**, and must include:
> - Context & Scope
> - Goals & Non-Goals  
> - Work Summary  
> - Design Considerations & Trade-offs
> - Key Implementation Logic  
> - Unit Test Plan  
> - Affected File Paths
> - Dependencies and Task Relationships
> - Cross-cutting Concerns

**If you encounter any errors during task creation, immediately report them to the user and wait for guidance before proceeding.**

---

#### 7. **Verify Task Creation**
- Confirm all created Tasks are correctly linked to the parent Work Item (User Story or the parent of the original Task).
- Verify that all tasks have the `Task-待檢核` tag applied for subsequent quality assurance.
- Display Task titles and IDs if available.

**If there are any issues or questions during verification, immediately report them to the user and wait for confirmation or guidance before proceeding to Step 8.**

---

#### 8. **Execute AI Verification for Created Tasks**
After all tasks are successfully created, directly execute PowerShell commands to trigger AI verification workflow for each task.

**Execute the following PowerShell script immediately using the actual Task IDs created in Step 6:**

```powershell
$taskIds = @(ACTUAL_TASK_ID_1, ACTUAL_TASK_ID_2, ACTUAL_TASK_ID_3)

Write-Host "🚀 Starting AI Verification for all tasks (Fire and Forget)..." -ForegroundColor Green

$taskIds = @({{TASK_ID_1}}, {{TASK_ID_2}}, {{TASK_ID_3}})  # Replace with actual Task IDs

foreach ($id in $taskIds) {
    Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
        param($taskId)
        
        $headers = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[[String],[String]]"
        $headers.Add("Authorization", "Bearer app-zg2G4L7FiABaeR0BAuLoA5Co")
        $headers.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
        
        $body = @"
        {
            `"inputs`": {
                `"vstsid`": $taskId
            },
            `"response_mode`": `"blocking`",
            `"user`": `"api-trigger`"
        }
"@
        
        Invoke-RestMethod 'https://dify.91app.biz/v1/workflows/run' -Method 'POST' -Headers $headers -Body $body
    } -ArgumentList $id
}

Write-Host "All verification requests sent! (Not waiting for responses)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Check Azure DevOps in a few moments for verification results" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

---

### ⚠️ Constraints
- Absolutely **no source code modification** in this session.
- Use **Markdown** for all planning responses.
- Use **Markdown** only for `Description` fields in Azure DevOps Tasks.
- Always wait for user confirmation before advancing to the next step.
- Follow Google design document conciseness principle: focus on design decisions rather than implementation details.
- **At any time, if you have questions, uncertainties, or require user input, pause and ask the user. Only proceed after receiving clear confirmation.**
- **Maximum 5 clarification questions** in Step 4.2 (clarification retries for same question do not count as new questions)
- Record each clarification immediately to Azure DevOps `Custom.ImplementPlan` field without overwriting existing content

---

### 📚 Design Document Core Principles
1. **Emphasize Trade-off Decisions**: Highlight why specific design approaches are chosen
2. **Appropriate Abstraction Level**: Avoid excessive technical details, focus on design logic
3. **Organizational Consensus**: Ensure designs can be understood and supported by the team
4. **Long-term Value**: Create documentation that aids future maintenance and expansion
5. **Cross-cutting Considerations**: Ensure security, performance, maintainability and other aspects are incorporated into considerations
6. **Structured Clarification**: Proactively identify and resolve ambiguities before implementation planning to reduce downstream rework risk
